description: "It’s becoming a thing… We are eagerly anticipating the Dragonette Rosé release yearly, and it seems like this year is better than before!

In time for spring, Dragonette fashioned a Happy Canyon (AVA) rosé that is comprised of 70% Grenache, 27% Mourvedre and 3% Syrah, native yeast fermented, exhibiting fresh-picked red berries, citrus peel and minerals. This year the wine shows a little more weight due to time increased time-in-barrel, while still displaying refreshing acidity that makes for a more dynamic rosé. It’s crisp, delicious and could be the perfect way to kick off a long evening of porch-sitting and spinning records, or to accompany a cheese board."
